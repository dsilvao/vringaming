  <h3>Potential advancements in VR technology.</h3>

  <p>
  VR still has a long way to go before it meets are expectations. Many of us have seen movies that use VR technology like Ready Player One and see that what we have right now is still a far from what we have in our heads. We should base our expectations on VR on other existing technology rather than fictional ones. As technology in general improves so will the technology used in VR. Fact remains that right now the technology simply isn’t there yet. So, keeping our expectation realistic may allow us to enjoy what we have a lot more.

   And while VR isn’t at that stage yet, it is on its way to getting there. We our currently seeing research being done into motion controllers to make them track any movement done by player rather than a limited variety. This would mean you would be able to do just about anything with the controllers and it will keep track of the movement. This would certainly make the experience more immersive. Advancements are also being done on eye tracking, which many argue is the future of VR and is superior to head tracking. With eye tracking we wouldn’t have move our head around all the time which could help with the reduction of motion sickness. Some of the prices right now are still far too much for the average gamer, but research is being done to make sure it is more accessible.  And as technology improves all around, Vr will become cheaper and more widely used.
